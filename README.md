## Problem Statement 
In emergency conditions sometimes our home appliances and gadgets like TV, refrigerator, computer, mobile deteriorate and we all face a problem in carrying them to big service centers for repairing. Another thing is the local service centers and technicians in our area, with the same skills and techniques, don't get a chance and are ignored because they don't have much reputation in the market.
In this pandemic, we want to seek help from nearby shops or freelancers and have minimum physical contact Through this website you can talk to the expert of your own choice from the recommendation list and inhale the guidance. The website encourages the local shops and freelance to grow more and develop more skills.The ONLINE MODE OF CONVERSATION feature will help stop the spread of covid-19 and other infections too.
So we are developing a solution that will assist people to overcome with there deteriorated gadgets as soon as possible. One can set a radius and quickly get connected to the nearest service center and workers
